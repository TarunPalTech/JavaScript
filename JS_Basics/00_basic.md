    There is no difference between .txt or .js file(Here, we can take any of the 
    extension as example), it is a controversial topic but the basic difference
    between these files are which of them we can inject in a particular software
    (like compiler and interpreter) and these softwares have the capability to understand 
    a particular syntax structure means here every token has a specific meaning to 
    perform a specific task like input, process, output. These softwares are capable to
    accept those files which belongs to a particular extension.

    The software of JavaScript(JIT Compiler) was came with the browser only and after
    sometime JS community decided that we will provide it separately so that a person
    who wants to execute it in a stand alone environment can be capable to execute it
    like C, C++, Python etc.

    After that, it is not only a browser language. Now, you can use it for mobile
    development, for frontend, for backend etc.

    Node JS is an open source, cross platform JS runtime environment.

    There is no need to install any software(execution environment) because you can 
    execute it directly on the browser but there is need to create an HTML and then
    you will link this js file to your HTML file. Now, you can execute it.

    There is an other way to use js, you can create a repo on GitHub after you can create
    your codespace on github. Here, you can code in any of the language but there is need
    to link Node js first. You can directly jump to the command pallete and then search
    for container and then search for Node js.
