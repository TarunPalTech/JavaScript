# JavaScript
## Basic Concepts of JavaScript.

There is no difference between .txt or .js file(we can choose any of the extension like .txt, .js etc), it is a controversial topic but the basic difference between these files is which of them we can inject in a particular software(like compiler or interpreter) because these softwares are capable to understand a particular syntax structure means here every token has a specific meaning to perform a spelcific task like user input, output, data processing etc. So, the JIT of JavaScript is able to take only those files which have .js extension.

JIT of JavaScript used to come embedded with the browser earlier. But, after sometime JS Community decided that they will provide ir separately so that a person or an oraganization that wants to execute it in a separate environment(stand alone environment) will be able to use it like C, C++, Python Java etc.

Now, it is not only a browser language, you can use it for mobile development, for frontend, for backend etc that you want.

Node.js is an open source, cross platform JS runtime environment.

There is no need to install any software(execution environment) because you can execute it directly on your browser but there is need to create an HTML file and then there is need to link your js file with your html file. Now you can execute it.

There is an other way to execute your js file, you can create a repository on GitHub after that you can create a codespace for it. Here, you can code in any of the language but there is need of some setup. You can directly jump on the command pallete and then search for container and then search for Node.js
